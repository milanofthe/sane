//! The dependency-count scheduler over the assembly forest.

use super::LlSchedule;
use crate::error::RslabError;

/// The left-looking factorization of the whole assembly forest, shared
/// by the LDLT/LU twins and scheduled by dependency counts instead of fork-join:
/// every node is one task, started by whichever thread finishes its last child.
/// `factor_node` and `emit_free` carry the path-specific kernels.
///
/// Under fork-join a parent runs on the thread that forked its children, after
/// that thread's wait returns - and a rayon wait executes other ready work
/// meanwhile, often a whole unrelated subtree, so the parent started long after
/// its last child had finished. On a 338k FEM system that gap was more than
/// half of the critical chain (1.0 to 1.1 s of 1.8 s at 12 threads). Here
/// nobody waits: a finished node counts down its parent and, as the last child,
/// hands the parent on as the next task. A stolen task is one node, never a
/// subtree. Per node the work is unchanged (factor, free every updater whose
/// last consumer it was, emit itself if nothing above reads it), and what a
/// node computes does not depend on the thread running it. There is no
/// recursion either, so deep chain trees need no large worker stacks here.
