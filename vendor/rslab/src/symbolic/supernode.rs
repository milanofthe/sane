/// Rationale:
/// - The first term is the loose worst-case upper bound: at most
///   one delay per eliminable column anywhere below `s` can reach
///   `s` (since delays are 1-for-1 fully-summed columns that
///   children failed to eliminate).
/// - The second term tightens that to a constant multiple of the
///   supernode's own width, which is the quantity that drives
///   frontal-matrix memory at numeric time (the frontal is sized
///   as `(own_ncol + n_delayed_in) x nrow`).
///
/// The `min` of the two is the cap actually enforced. For leaves
/// (no children, `subtree_ncol == own_ncol`) the first term is 0,
/// so leaves always get `delayed_capacity == 0` - which is
/// trivially correct (leaves have no children that could send
/// delays). For interior nodes the K-bound is usually tighter
/// than the worst-case bound; for tall thin chains the
/// worst-case bound can be tighter.

/// Pre-condition: `snodes` is in postorder (children before parents),
