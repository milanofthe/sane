//! Monotonic clock for the ordering crates' stats timing, portable to targets
//! without an OS clock (wasm32-unknown-unknown: `std::time::Instant::now()`
//! panics with "time not implemented on this platform", which trapped every
//! symbolic analysis in the browser). Native builds re-export
//! [`std::time::Instant`] unchanged; on wasm32 the instant is inert and every
//! duration reads zero, so `OrderingStats` timings become no-ops instead of
//! trapping.
