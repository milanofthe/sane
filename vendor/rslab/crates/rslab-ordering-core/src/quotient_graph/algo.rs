//! AMD elimination-loop primitives: pivot selection and element
//! construction (plus standard absorption).
//!
//! This module lands Commit 4 of the Slice A plan. It ports faer's
//! `amd.rs:220-365` line-by-line:
//!
//! - [`select_pivot`]: linear scan from `mindeg`, LIFO unlink.
//! - [`create_element`]: both the in-place (`elenme == 0`) and
//!   out-of-place (`elenme > 0`) branches, plus standard absorption
//!   fired at the end of each `knt1` iter (faer `amd.rs:355-358`),
//!   and the final bookkeeping write-back to `pe[me]/len[me]/elen[me]`
//!   with the post-step `clear_flag` call.
//!
//! Inline garbage collection (faer `amd.rs:289-338`) fires inside
//! the out-of-place branch when `pfree >= iwlen`. See
//! [`create_element`] for the full save -> mark -> compact -> restore
//! dance.
//!
//! Pass-1 `w[e]` seeding (`amd.rs:366-385`), Pass-2 approximate
//! degree (`amd.rs:386-465`), aggressive absorption, monotone
//! degree cap, and re-insertion into degree lists (`amd.rs:516-546`)
//! live in [`finalize_step`]. Mass elimination and supervariable
//! detection are Slice B (Commits 9-10).

/// 6. **Supervariable detection** (`amd.rs:467-515`): for each
///    hash chain whose anchor is still marked, walk the chain and
///    merge indistinguishable followers into the head.
/// 7. **Re-insert** (`amd.rs:516-537`): each surviving variable's
///    updated degree is pushed back onto `head[deg]` LIFO and
///    `mindeg` is lowered if needed.
/// 8. **Me bookkeeping** (`amd.rs:538-546`): restore `nv[me] =
