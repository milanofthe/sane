//! Supernodal, tree-parallel triangular solves for the sparse LDL^T factor.
//!
//! A scalar CSC factor is the wrong layout for a solve: every entry costs a
//! value, a `usize` row index and a random access into the right-hand side,
//! on one core. The plan works on the factor in *supernodal panel form*
//! ([`PanelFactor`]): one dense column-major panel per supernode (unit-lower
//! diagonal block on top, the off-block rows below) with a single shared
//! list of `u32` row indices. The LDL^T drivers produce that form directly,
//! so the plan takes the panels as its storage without a copy; a CSC factor
//! (the LU path) is converted once. A forward or backward sweep then streams
//! contiguous panels, touches each row index once per panel instead of once
//! per entry, and runs the inner loops over contiguous memory.
//!
//! Parallelism comes from the supernodal elimination tree. The tree is cut
//! into a fixed number of independent leaf subtrees ([`LEAF_SUBTREES`], not a
//! function of the thread count) plus the ancestors above the cut. In the
//! forward sweep the subtrees run in parallel; updates that leave a subtree
//! (into ancestor rows) go to a per-subtree accumulator and are reduced in
//! subtree order before the ancestors are processed sequentially, their
//! large panels row-parallel. In the backward sweep the ancestors go first
//! and the subtrees then run in parallel reading only final values. Every
//! sum is formed in the same order for every thread count, so the solution
//! is bit-identical from one thread to many.

// The kernels index several parallel arrays (panels, row lists, slots,
// right-hand sides) at offset positions; index loops read closer to the
// linear algebra than zipped iterators would.
