//! Generic multifrontal sparse LDL^T factorization over any [`Scalar`] field.
//!
//! This drives a full sparse symmetric-indefinite solve for both the real
//! (`f64`) and complex-*symmetric* (`Complex<f64>`, PARDISO `mtype 6`) paths by
//! reusing the existing **value-agnostic** symbolic analysis (ordering,
//! elimination tree, supernode amalgamation) and applying the generic dense
//! Bunch-Kaufman kernel from [`crate::dense::ldlt_generic`] front-by-front.
//!
//! This is the single, data-type-generic symmetric multifrontal driver (the
//! former f64-dedicated driver has been removed). It is rayon-parallel with a
//! `gemm` BLAS-3 Schur update and relaxed amalgamation, and it also hosts the
//! left-looking supernodal kernel ([`FactorMethod::LeftLooking`], the shipped
//! default) over the same symbolic analysis.
//!
//! ## Pivoting scope
//!
//! * Pivoting is restricted to the **fully-summed block** of each front: dense
//!   Bunch-Kaufman with 1x1 and 2x2 pivots, so an indefinite block (a KKT
//!   saddle, a circuit's zero-diagonal source row next to its node) factors
//!   whenever the pair sits in one front, which the amalgamation makes the
//!   common case (a 45k-node power grid: 1690 2x2 pivots, no failure). There
//!   is no delayed pivoting: a fully-summed block that is singular in exact
//!   mode surfaces as [`RslabError::NumericallyRankDeficient`], and the
//!   static-pivot mode ([`ZeroPivotAction`], the `preconditioner` settings)
//!   lifts the pivot to the floor instead and reports it in `n_perturbed`.
//! * The global factor `L` is kept in supernodal panel form
//!   ([`PanelFactor`]): each supernode's dense panel, once its last consumer
//!   is done, is finished in place (off-block rows into elimination order,
//!   the 2x2 couplings cleared, `drop_tol` applied) and becomes the stored
//!   factor, so the memory peak is the resident panels themselves (see the
//!   a-priori [`MemoryEstimate`](crate::diagnostics::MemoryEstimate)).
//!
//! The result is an [`LdltNumeric`] in factorization order: the panels plus
//! `D`, the permutation and the outcome. [`LdltNumeric::into_factors`]
//! materializes the compressed-column [`LdltFactors`] for the generic
//! [`solve_ldlt`](crate::dense::ldlt_generic::solve_ldlt).
