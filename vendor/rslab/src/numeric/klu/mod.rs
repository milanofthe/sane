//! KLU-style sparse LU: BTF + per-block left-looking Gilbert-Peierls.
//!
//! The third direct path next to the supernodal LDL^T and LU, built for
//! circuit-shaped matrices: extremely sparse, unsymmetric, near-triangularizable,
//! with diagonal blocks far too small for supernodal/BLAS-3 kernels to pay off.
//! Algorithmic reference: SuiteSparse KLU (Davis & Palamadai Natarajan); this is
//! an independent pure-Rust implementation, no FFI.
//!
//! Pipeline:
//!
//! 1. **Analyze** ([`KluSymbolic::analyze`]): maximum transversal + Tarjan SCC
//!    ([`crate::ordering::btf`]) permute the matrix to block *upper* triangular
//!    form with a zero-free diagonal (structural singularity is detected here),
//!    then AMD orders each irreducible diagonal block on its symmetrized
//!    pattern.
//! 2. **Factor** ([`KluSymbolic::factor`]): each diagonal block is factored by
//!    a left-looking Gilbert-Peierls LU, per-column depth-first reach on the
//!    growing L pattern, so the numeric work is proportional to the flop count,
//!    with threshold partial pivoting that prefers the (structurally nonzero)
//!    diagonal. Off-block entries are not factored; they only enter the block
//!    back-substitution. Optional row-max scaling equilibrates the rows first.
//! 3. **Refactor** ([`KluSolver::refactor`]): numeric-only re-factorization for
//!    a matrix with the *same* pattern (frequency sweeps, Newton steps): the
//!    stored pattern and pivot sequence are replayed with no symbolic work and
//!    no pivot search. A changed pattern is detected and rejected; a pivot that
//!    became zero under the frozen pivot order fails cleanly so the caller can
//!    re-[`factor`](KluSymbolic::factor) with pivoting.
//!
//! Each block factors sequentially, and independent blocks may factor in
//! parallel ([`KluParallel`]); the results are bit-identical across runs and
//! thread counts.
