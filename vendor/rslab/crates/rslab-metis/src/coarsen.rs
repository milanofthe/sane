//! Multilevel coarsening.
//!
//! Sorted Heavy-Edge Matching (SHEM): iterate vertices in ascending
//! degree order (ties broken by a seeded random permutation) and, for
//! each unmatched vertex, pair it with its unmatched neighbor of
//! maximum edge weight (ties broken by lower vertex id). Visiting
//! low-degree vertices first - the "sorted" in SHEM - keeps a leaf
//! from being stranded when its sole neighbor is claimed by a
//! higher-degree vertex. If the reduction ratio falls below the
//! configured threshold (default 0.85 per METIS 5.2.0), a simple
//! 2-hop fallback pairs unmatched vertices that share a common
//! neighbor. This keeps power-law-degree KKT graphs from stalling
//! the coarsening pipeline.
//!
//! Contraction then folds the fine graph into a coarse graph:
//! parallel edges between the same coarse endpoints are **summed**,
//! self-loops (edges inside a merged pair) are **dropped**, vertex
//! weights accumulate.
