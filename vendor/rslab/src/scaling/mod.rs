//! Global scaling for sparse symmetric indefinite matrices.
//!
//! Implements MC64-style matching-based scaling following
//! Duff & Koster 2001 and Duff & Pralet 2005, using a pure-Rust
//! Hungarian algorithm. The resulting scaling vector `s` is applied
//! symmetrically: `A |-> diag(s) * A * diag(s)` before factorization.
//!
//! Design: see `dev/research/mc64-scaling.md`.
//! Plan:   see `dev/plans/mc64-scaling.md`.
//!
//! This module is Phase 2.2.1 work - closing the residual gap that
//! Phase 2.1.2's sanity check exposed on n > 500 matrices.
//!
//! ## Quick reference
//!
//! The caller computes scaling via `compute_scaling(matrix, strategy)`,
//! which returns `(Vec<f64>, ScalingInfo)`. The vector is in user-order
//! indexing (same numbering as the input CSC's row/column indices).
//! It is the responsibility of later symbolic-factorization code to
//! permute the vector into pivot-order before handing off to the
//! numeric phase.
//!
//! Once the scaling vector is available, three things must happen:
//!
//!   1. During frontal assembly in `numeric::factorize`, each original
//!      matrix entry `a[i,j]` is multiplied by `s[i] * s[j]` as it is
//!      scattered into the frontal matrix.
//!   2. In `numeric::solve`, the right-hand side `b` is pre-scaled by
//!      `b[i] *= s[i]` at the permutation boundary before the forward
//!      sweep.
//!   3. In `numeric::solve`, the solution `x` is post-scaled by
//!      `x[i] *= s[i]` at the un-permutation boundary after the
//!      backward sweep. **Same vector on both ends**, not its
//!      inverse - see the research note for the derivation.
